  description: "8×8 systolic array neural network accelerator – 64 MACs, 19.2 GFLOPS @150MHz INT8 for tinyML / edge inference"
  language: "Verilog"
  clock_hz: 150000000
  tiles: "1x1"

pinout:
  # Clock and reset (standard for digital designs)
  - {name: clk,    type: clk,   direction: input}
  - {name: rstn,   type: rstn,  direction: input}
  
  # Inputs: 8 activations (8-bit each, but pinout shows buses)
  - {name: act_in, type: anain, direction: input, width: 8}  # Bus for activations
  
  # Inputs: 64 weights (8x8, 8-bit each — bus for simplicity)
  - {name: wgt_in, type: anain, direction: input, width: 64}  # Bus for weights
  
  # Outputs: 8 partial sums (32-bit accumulators — bus)
  - {name: psum_out, type: anaout, direction: output, width: 8}  # Bus for results
  
  # Control signals
  - {name: load_weights, type: anain, direction: input}
  - {name: compute_go,   type: anain, direction: input}
  - {name: compute_done, type: anaout, direction: output}
